Setting up a Social Media Marketing strategy is hard. 
Adding to that, putting social media and Cannabis into the mix makes it even more trickier - how to take your dispensary business to the next level when Instagram is known to be somewhat hostile to the promotion of Cannabis business? 

Instagram has laid out a few guidelines for the promotion of Cannabis dispensaries on its platform. So, if you follow those, there's no reason to miss out on the enormous marketing reach it has to offer. 

Since the sale of any canna products is essentially not permitted via the site, you can and should, at the very least, use its might to build and promote your brand. 

We conducted research and studied strategies that have worked out for businesses operating in the same realm. We sifted through several cannabis business pages that have a high rate of engagement (50-100 comments or more on each post) and an incredibly loyal following (thousands of followers). 

Here are <b>3 proven strategies</b> we found that you can incorporate into your Instagram marketing plan right away.

### 1. Pick an aesthetic to build your brand identity
> There are few things more powerful than building a brand. People recognize a brand - that is known knowledge. 

> But developing an aesthetic? Now, that's something not many pages tend to concentrate on. 

> Reel people in by setting and sticking with an aesthetic that matches the energy of the culture and industry you are in and watch your following grow.

> Picking a well-loved aesthetic would require gaining insight into the minds and expectations of your future followers and the product you are selling. 

### 2. Regularly post some lit content (pun intended) 
> It sounds like your average, run-of-the-mill advice.  But what exactly constitutes "great content" in this sphere? 

> It gets tricky because Instagram doesn't like to see posts that directly mention in text or show pictures of cannabis. 

> So where does that leave us? Let's discuss how to keep your content calendar full and updated for months in advance. 

- ### Educational content
Take advantage of this opportunity and educate people about the varieties you sell, the industry in general, the history behind it, trailblazers in the community who paved the way to where we stand today, the chemistry and biology of what happens once it enters our bodies, why and how it's deemed medicinal, to name a few.

> **The key is to position your content as strictly educational instead of commercial.**

- ### Latest news (pertaining to your city, state, country, or the industry in general)
There's always some new and interesting development taking place around the world regarding this up-and-coming industry. 

> **Get your users up to speed with the latest news and keep them well-informed.**

- ### Host Q&As: 
Q&As can be an excellent source of connecting with your audience and essentially doing market research. 

> Ask people about their pattern of cannabis consumption, their favorite places to go or activities to do when they are baked, their favorite munchies, anything they'd like to see in the market that is missing. 

> **Use it as a tool that serves the dual purpose of striking a chord with your following and assessing the market.**


- ### Share behind-the-scenes of running and growing (\*wink) your business: 
Bring visibility to your backend efforts. It could be a parade you attended that celebrated legalization in a state or country, or a campaign your founders or employees back that supports the cause and culture. 

> **As long as it feels sincere, your followers will be delighted to learn more about you.**

### 3. Support a cause greater than yourself
> Just because you run or contribute adjacently to the cannabis business, doesn't mean you have to confine your identity to your cause only. 

> Bring attention to and show your solidarity towards causes and people trying to do their bit for changing the world for the better. 

> People want to support brands that aren't one-dimensional and contribute to the betterment of society. It doesn't hurt to have followers who actually think you are a living body, not just a front for business.

All these strategies are tried and tested and guaranteed to push your engagement through the roof. 

Add these strategies to your Instagram marketing plan and see your campaign turn into a huge success.
