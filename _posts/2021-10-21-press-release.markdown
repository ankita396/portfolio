### *ifeel’s mission is to facilitate personalized online therapy with the help of licensed health professionals, based on a subscription model.*

**Madrid, Spain., May. 5, 2021** -- ifeel, the disruptive mental health-focused startup, has scored €5.5M in Series A funding led by pan-European Venture Capital firm, Nauta Capital.  
Ifeel is reimagining people’s approach towards caring for their mental health, both on personal and professional fronts. Founded in 2017 as a customer-centric platform, it transitioned to a hybrid model in 2020, answering to a rise in demand from companies looking to invest in the mental well-being of their employees. So, the service is available starting with weekly subscriptions for individuals or under employer’s or insurance provider’s cover.

Ifeel stands out from mindfulness apps and other therapy platforms with the help of its AI-powered platform and range of services that focus on providing personalized support. It facilitates one-on-one video therapy sessions with licensed psychologists along with delivering self-care tools like daily mood trackers, guided chats and recommended activities.

“The health crisis and new blended employment models create a high need for managers to support remote employees and distant customers”, says Amir Kaplan, CEO, and co-founder of ifeel. “We believe smart emotional support services will be a must-have benefit in the near future as the impact is so high. The safe and anonymous access to ifeel allows employees to improve their life with no need of manager referral,”

Comment from Jordi Vinas, General Partner at Nauta Capital aligns with the company’s mission. “We believe iFeel’s approach has an edge over competitors, thanks to having a holistic platform that covers both prevention and intervention and that includes multiple user touchpoints (self-care tools and guided chat and 1-on-1 video therapies), combined with its full integration to business and distribution partners and its global coverage in several languages. We’re excited to join the team in their journey to truly transform the emotional well-being space.”

Following a monumental shift in how we define ‘working’ nowadays, it makes complete sense to acknowledge the mental toll it has and will require going forward. ifeel aims to be the bold new solution that equips you with its unique set of self-care tools and therapy services to care for your mental health and beyond.
