## How to Make Aluminum Window Frames Look Better?

It’s a pity that aluminum window frames weather scratches, dullness, discoloration and lose their sheen over time. Painting them is an easy and inexpensive process to refurbish their tired, worn look. Let’s explore how to paint and give your aluminum window frames a complete makeover.

  

**Safety precautions**:

DIY projects are fun and extremely satisfying. But taking safety precautions while handling such chemical substances is paramount. Wear gloves, safety goggles and respirators or masks while performing the next steps and keep your vicinity well ventilated to prevent buildup of toxic chemicals in the air.

It’s also advisable to protect your glass panes and surrounding walls while you perform this entire operation. Use Painter’s tape to seal off the glass from the frame and masking paper or plastic to protect the rest of the glass area. Also, use drip sheets on the floor to keep them from staining or any paint mishap.

  

   * **Cleaning your frames**:
    
It’s tricky to make paint adhere to metal surfaces. It’s even trickier when there is dust, grime and debris present between the metal and paint coats. It’s therefore, necessary to clean your window frames thoroughly before moving on to the next steps.

You can clean your frames using a no-soap or mild soap solution and a soft cloth. Micro-fiber cloth would be the gentlest option. If there is any indication of rust, try using a soft sandpaper to remove the layers and clean the remains. Make sure to pat dry the frames, especially the grooves and joints, so that there is no water deposit.

   * **Applying Primer**:
    
Priming is an essential step that, however tempting it may seem, should not be missed. Priming provides the metal surface with a smooth finish and prepares it to accept paint coats flawlessly.

The primer you choose should be oil-based and primarily come with rust-inhibitive properties. You could also go for self-etching primers as they lend enhanced adhesion to the paint. You can get a paint brush or roller to apply the primer or go for various spray paint primers. Spray paint primers are preferred as they help in applying thin coats which is the key to give your aluminum window frames a high-finish, professional look after the paint job.

After applying primer to your window frames, let that primer settle for a few hours before you start with the painting process.

* **Applying Paint**:
    

Now that your window frames are cleaned, primed and fully prepped, they are ready to be painted over.

High-quality acrylic paints tend to be the best kind of paints for aluminum window frames. Make sure to check the paint instructions beforehand and verify if it’s suitable to be used on aluminum.

Also, metal spray paints are a great option to reduce any incidence of excess buildup or dripping. Spray paints are easier to handle and manuever in order to render thin coats of paint which is essential to achieve an even finish.

Your application should be steady with back and forth movements, all the while ensuring that the coats are even and thin. Let layers dry for a few minutes in case of spray paints and a period of 6-7 hours in case of acrylic paint before going for more layers.

Leave your paint to dry and check for any textural defects. If you find any, scrape them off with a sleak blade causing minimum damage. Voila! Your window frames will be looking as good as new.

  

## What is the cost to paint aluminum window frames?

The whole cost of the project would depend upon the size and number of window frames you need to paint. If you have a few window frames to paint, then it’s safe to estimate that you will be able to wrap up the **whole project in under $150**. If you have a lot of area to cover, then you might have to compare the cost of doing it all by yourself with hiring professionals for the same.

On average, it’d take around one to two standard cans of spray for a single large window. Considering this and that you have the cleaning supplies and other optional supplies like ladder at hand, here’s the rest of your cost estimate:

-   A can of spray paint: $10-$15 for 12oz,
    Or, Acrylic paint: $45 to $50 per gallon,

-   Paint Primer: $15 to $25 per gallon,
    
-   Drop Cloth: $10-$30

For this task, you will need supplies such as masking paper, painter’s tape, drop clothes, sandpaper, safety goggles, ladder etc in addition to the primer and paint. If you choose to go for spraying your primer and paint, you will save on time and costs since you can skip out on buying paint brushes or rollers. Spray paints also dry faster than other kinds of paints.
