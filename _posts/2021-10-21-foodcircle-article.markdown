# FoodSquare, a social enterprise with a mission to reduce food waste
Food wastage has become a dire issue that is growing in scale as the need to feed the growing population of the world skyrockets every day.

Before we go any further, let's look at three **mind-blowing food waste statistics** :

* If food loss were a country, it would be the **[third-largest](https://earth.org/facts-about-food-waste/)** greenhouse gas emitter, behind China and the US.

* The water used to produce the food wasted could be used by **[9,000,000,000(bn)](https://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/food-waste-facts)** people at around 200 liters per person per day.

* The food currently wasted in Europe could feed **200,000,000(million)** people, lost or wasted food in Latin America could feed **300,000,000(million)** people and, in Africa, it could feed **300,000,000(million)** people.

Do you see the number of zeroes trailing those figures? Quite understandably, it's hard to wrap our minds around figures so large while seeing tiny instances of food getting wasted in our everyday lives.

But the matter of curbing food waste is an urgent one, as its economic and environmental impact is along the lines of global warming.

To discuss this matter further, we have with us today Konstantina, who's in charge of Social Media and Promotion at foodsquare.com.

**Interviewer**: *Hello Konstantina! Welcome to this interview and thank you for participating in the project Food Waste Around the World. Before we begin, can you tell a little bit about yourself and where are you from?*

**Konstantina**: Thank you for having me today. I hail from a little town in Greece. Five years ago, I decided that I would move abroad and I began working on this internship in Amsterdam recently.
Amsterdam has so many opportunities to offer - it's safe to say that it truly has something for everyone. I knew I could find and try different things here.

**Interviewer**: *Interesting. And how is the food waste situation in Greece? Is it a big issue?*

Konstantina: I grew up seeing my family and the people around me buy large quantities of food and groceries.

But at the same time, I saw the stark reality of people starving on the streets - next to garbage cans, unable to buy food for themselves. I think this is one of the reasons behind my sensitivity towards food wastage.

It's sad to see but, not enough people are working on it or are even sentient of this issue. Most of the food waste comes from fruits and vegetables in my opinion.

>According to a survey conducted by [Respect Food](https://www.respectfood.com/article/11-facts-about-food-wastage/), **63%** of people don’t know the difference between **“use by”** and **“best before”** dates. Foods with “use by” dates are perishable and must be eaten before the given date. Foods with “best before” dates can be eaten after the given date, but they won’t be at their best quality. In developing countries, 40% of losses occur at the post-harvest and processing stages, while in developed countries, more than 40% of losses occur at the retail and consumer levels.

**Interviewer**: *Yeah, I agree. Who is really driving the attention on the food waste issue there? Are there any NGOs or small communities that work on this? Do you know of any initiatives?*

**Konstantina**: I know there are several non-profit organisations and NGOs who are actively tackling this issue. They organize activities and campaigns to prevent food waste.I participated in volunteering activities where we provided food for people that included immigrants and refugees.

These initiatives are taken on a local level, but sadly, they are not so widespread. I've noticed that there's not a lot of articles or advertisement campaigns for driving people's attention to this issue in any city.

**Interviewer**: *Interesting. So you have been living in Amsterdam for a while now. Have you noticed any difference in what you see in the Netherlands as compared to Greece, regarding the food waste situation?*

**Konstantina**: I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of initiatives being taken here in this regard. I could see that the network here is far and wide. There's a broad range of initiatives that curb food waste and spread awareness among people. You can see the various ways food waste is reimagined instead of being wasted.

>In **developing countries, 40%** of losses occur at the post-harvest and processing stages, while in **developed countries, more than 40%** of losses occur at the retail and consumer levels.

**Interviewer**: *I see. Thinking about your country, what do you think could be the next possible step of action by different groups or NGOs, and also the government to reduce food waste?*

**Konstantina**: I'm yet to see any particular interest or huge initiatives taken by the government.

I think all of them should try to achieve more visibility and promote their actions through digital channels and social media to send this message across to young people. Having grown up in fairly prosperous households, they tend to have little sensitivity towards food wastage than say, middle-aged people. Having more than enough food has led to them taking it for granted. This attitude needs to change.

**Interviewer**: *Absolutely. Anything you would like to add?*

**Konstantina**: Yes, a few words about the kind of thinking I just touched upon. When we go to restaurants, if they bring us a decent portion of food, we complain that we paid too much to deserve such small portions. But if they bring us huge portions, we feel satisfied even when we don't finish it all, eventually contributing to wastage. This needs to change and it's up to us.

I do believe changing our outlook will be a small step in the right direction. That is all I wanted to add. Thank you.

> The EU and Member States are committed to meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), adopted in September 2015, including a target to halve per capita food waste at the retail and consumer level by 2030 and reduce food losses along the food production and supply chains.

Aligned with Konstantina's beliefs, **fruits and vegetables do have the highest wastage rates, followed by meat and milk**. Annual per capita household food waste (in kilograms per year) of **Greece is among the highest in the world at 142, next to only Nigeria at 189**, as of 2020, according to this [study](https://www.statista.com/statistics/933059/per-capita-food-waste-of-selected-countries/) by Statista.

It remains a grim situation but with the help of NGOs and other institutions, this matter can capture the greater part of the public's attention and change for the better.

If you want to raise awareness about this issue or educate yourself, here are a few food waste initiatives operating in Greece that you can be a part of:

• **[BOROUME](https://www.boroume.gr/en/)** is a non-profit organisation that fights food waste by organizing the distribution of surplus food for charity throughout Greece.

• **[Bread and Action](https://artosdrasi.rei.gr/)** collects and distributes large edible food leftovers or cooked food, to needy service centers.

• **[Sustainablegastronomy](https://www.sustainablegastronomy.eu/blog.aspx)** has a blog that regularly shares information about the practices and impacts revolving around food waste and management incentives in Greece

Wastage of food is a blatant affront to all the resources that go into producing, packaging, and distributing it. It not only affects the people and the economy in myriad ways, but it harms major natural resources such as air, water, and land. To reduce food waste, we need to focus on all aspects of the supply chain and increase the quality and quantity of governmental regulations, to name a few. Needless to say, educating the public about the consequences of food waste and management must be one of the top priorities so that we can all play our small roles in tackling this epidemic.
