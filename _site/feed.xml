&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;versioning&quot;&gt;Versioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC supports versioning so that our internal and external stakeholders (developers, users, businesses) can stay up-to-date with changes and new releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org/&quot;&gt;Semantic Versioning 2.0.0&lt;/a&gt; convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Versions are named as follows: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Major&lt;/strong&gt; version is released when backwards-incompatible (outlined below) changes are implemented. Following is a non-exhaustive list of changes that warrants a major version release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removal of an API endpoint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removal of an API attribute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change in any API data formats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Database changes which can not be migrated automatically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change in script syntax, which may break existing scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Minor&lt;/strong&gt; version is released on the implementation of backwards-compatible (outlined below) changes. Following is a non-exhaustive list of changes that warrants a minor version release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addition of an API endpoint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addition of an API attribute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Database changes which can be migrated automatically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change in script syntax which can be migrated automatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Patch&lt;/strong&gt; version is released with bug fixes and minor improvements which do not cause any backward incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;v1.3.2 - signifies this is the first major release. It has 3 minor versions with 2 patches in this minor version
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;curious-about-the-latest-changes&quot;&gt;Curious about the latest changes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current version is &lt;strong&gt;v3.4.3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about our version timelines, release dates and changes on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://fakelink.com/releases&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deprecation&quot;&gt;Deprecation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep our services in line with customer expectations, certain outdated features are replaced with better functionalities from time to time. APIs are also deprecated to minimize critical security risks and to ensure legal compliance. We take the following steps to mitigate the effect of API deprecations and make the transition smoother for our users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feature deprecations are released with a minor version.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part of the feature (which needs to be changed) is deprecated before introducing the backwards-incompatible change. This ensures a wide window for clients to prepare for the upcoming change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An alternative is usually available at the time of deprecation so no additional transition time is needed once the backwards-incompatible change is introduced.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deprecated APIs are announced in the changelog of the release where the deprecation was introduced to keep users informed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;support-cycle&quot;&gt;Support cycle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provide support to each major version for a period of at least two years starting from the first release of that major version. The support cycle for the latest major version is continued until a new major version is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the support period, we do not add minor releases to past major versions, but we may add patch updates if required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not adhere to a fixed release schedule. Our efforts are always geared towards keeping the platform stable with the least amount of incompatible changes. We aim to minimize the number of major releases and guarantee that there won’t be more than one major release per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up a Social Media Marketing strategy is hard. 
Adding to that, putting social media and Cannabis into the mix makes it even more trickier - how to take your dispensary business to the next level when Instagram is known to be somewhat hostile to the promotion of Cannabis businesses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram has laid out a few guidelines for the promotion of Cannabis dispensaries on its platform. So, if you follow those, there’s no reason to miss out on the enormous marketing reach it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the sale of any canna products is essentially not permitted via the site, you can and should, at the very least, use its might to build and promote your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted research and studied strategies that have worked out for businesses operating in the same realm. We sifted through several cannabis business pages that have a high rate of engagement (50-100 comments or more on each post) and an incredibly loyal following (thousands of followers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are &lt;b&gt;3 proven strategies&lt;/b&gt; we found that you can incorporate into your Instagram marketing plan right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-pick-an-aesthetic-to-build-your-brand-identity&quot;&gt;1. Pick an aesthetic to build your brand identity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few things more powerful than building a brand. People recognize a brand - that is known knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But developing an aesthetic? Now, that’s something not many pages tend to concentrate on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reel people in by setting and sticking with an aesthetic that matches the energy of the culture and industry you are in and watch your following grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Picking a well-loved aesthetic would require gaining insight into the minds and expectations of your future followers and the product you are selling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-regularly-post-some-lit-content-pun-intended&quot;&gt;2. Regularly post some lit content (pun intended)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like your average, run-of-the-mill advice.  But what exactly constitutes “great content” in this sphere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets tricky because Instagram doesn’t like to see posts that directly mention in text or show pictures of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave us? Let’s discuss how to keep your content calendar full and updated for months in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;educational-content&quot;&gt;Educational content&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take advantage of this opportunity and educate people about the varieties you sell, the industry in general, the history behind it, trailblazers in the community who paved the way to where we stand today, the chemistry and biology of what happens once it enters our bodies, why and how it’s deemed medicinal, to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The key is to position your content as strictly educational instead of commercial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;latest-news-pertaining-to-your-city-state-country-or-the-industry-in-general&quot;&gt;Latest news (pertaining to your city, state, country, or the industry in general)&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s always some new and interesting development taking place around the world regarding this up-and-coming industry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Get your users up to speed with the latest news and keep them well-informed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;host-qas&quot;&gt;Host Q&amp;amp;As:&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q&amp;amp;As can be an excellent source of connecting with your audience and essentially doing market research. 
Ask people about their pattern of cannabis consumption, their favorite places to go or activities to do when they are baked, their favorite munchies, anything they’d like to see in the market that is missing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Use it as a tool that serves the dual purpose of striking a chord with your following and assessing the market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;share-behind-the-scenes-of-running-and-growing-wink-your-business&quot;&gt;Share behind-the-scenes of running and growing (*wink) your business:&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bring visibility to your backend efforts. It could be a parade you attended that celebrated legalization in a state or country, or a campaign your founders or employees back that supports the cause and culture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;As long as it feels sincere, your followers will be delighted to learn more about you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-support-a-cause-greater-than-yourself&quot;&gt;3. Support a cause greater than yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you run or contribute adjacently to the cannabis business, doesn’t mean you have to confine your identity to your cause only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bring attention to and show your solidarity towards causes and people trying to do their bit for changing the world for the better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People want to support brands that aren’t one-dimensional and contribute to the betterment of society. It doesn’t hurt to have followers who actually think you are a living body, not just a front for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these strategies are tried and tested and guaranteed to push your engagement through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add these strategies to your Instagram marketing plan and see your campaign turn into a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ankita Parida</name></author><category term="Blog" /><category term="B2B" /><category term="Content Marketing" /><category term="Sample" /><summary type="html">3 Proven Instagram Strategies to Take Your Cannabis Business to the Next Level Setting up a Social Media Marketing strategy is hard.

&lt;p&gt;Food wastage has become a dire issue that is growing in scale as the need to feed the growing population of the world skyrockets every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we go any further, let’s look at three &lt;strong&gt;mind-blowing food waste statistics&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If food loss were a country, it would be the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://earth.org/facts-about-food-waste/&quot;&gt;third-largest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; greenhouse gas emitter, behind China and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The water used to produce the food wasted could be used by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/food-waste-facts&quot;&gt;9,000,000,000(bn)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; people at around 200 liters per person per day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The food currently wasted in Europe could feed &lt;strong&gt;200,000,000(million)&lt;/strong&gt; people, lost or wasted food in Latin America could feed &lt;strong&gt;300,000,000(million)&lt;/strong&gt; people and, in Africa, it could feed &lt;strong&gt;300,000,000(million)&lt;/strong&gt; people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see the number of zeroes trailing those figures? Quite understandably, it’s hard to wrap our minds around figures so large while seeing tiny instances of food getting wasted in our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the matter of curbing food waste is an urgent one, as its economic and environmental impact is along the lines of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discuss this matter further, we have with us today Konstantina, who’s in charge of Social Media and Promotion at foodsquare.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Hello Konstantina! Welcome to this interview and thank you for participating in the project Food Waste Around the World. Before we begin, can you tell a little bit about yourself and where are you from?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Konstantina&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you for having me today. I hail from a little town in Greece. Five years ago, I decided that I would move abroad and I began working on this internship in Amsterdam recently.
Amsterdam has so many opportunities to offer - it’s safe to say that it truly has something for everyone. I knew I could find and try different things here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Interesting. And how is the food waste situation in Greece? Is it a big issue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Konstantina: I grew up seeing my family and the people around me buy large quantities of food and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, I saw the stark reality of people starving on the streets - next to garbage cans, unable to buy food for themselves. I think this is one of the reasons behind my sensitivity towards food wastage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s sad to see but, not enough people are working on it or are even sentient of this issue. Most of the food waste comes from fruits and vegetables in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to a survey conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.respectfood.com/article/11-facts-about-food-wastage/&quot;&gt;Respect Food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;63%&lt;/strong&gt; of people don’t know the difference between &lt;strong&gt;“use by”&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;“best before”&lt;/strong&gt; dates. Foods with “use by” dates are perishable and must be eaten before the given date. Foods with “best before” dates can be eaten after the given date, but they won’t be at their best quality. In developing countries, 40% of losses occur at the post-harvest and processing stages, while in developed countries, more than 40% of losses occur at the retail and consumer levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Yeah, I agree. Who is really driving the attention on the food waste issue there? Are there any NGOs or small communities that work on this? Do you know of any initiatives?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Konstantina&lt;/strong&gt;: I know there are several non-profit organisations and NGOs who are actively tackling this issue. They organize activities and campaigns to prevent food waste.I participated in volunteering activities where we provided food for people that included immigrants and refugees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These initiatives are taken on a local level, but sadly, they are not so widespread. I’ve noticed that there’s not a lot of articles or advertisement campaigns for driving people’s attention to this issue in any city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Interesting. So you have been living in Amsterdam for a while now. Have you noticed any difference in what you see in the Netherlands as compared to Greece, regarding the food waste situation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Konstantina&lt;/strong&gt;: I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of initiatives being taken here in this regard. I could see that the network here is far and wide. There’s a broad range of initiatives that curb food waste and spread awareness among people. You can see the various ways food waste is reimagined instead of being wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;developing countries, 40%&lt;/strong&gt; of losses occur at the post-harvest and processing stages, while in &lt;strong&gt;developed countries, more than 40%&lt;/strong&gt; of losses occur at the retail and consumer levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;I see. Thinking about your country, what do you think could be the next possible step of action by different groups or NGOs, and also the government to reduce food waste?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Konstantina&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m yet to see any particular interest or huge initiatives taken by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think all of them should try to achieve more visibility and promote their actions through digital channels and social media to send this message across to young people. Having grown up in fairly prosperous households, they tend to have little sensitivity towards food wastage than say, middle-aged people. Having more than enough food has led to them taking it for granted. This attitude needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Absolutely. Anything you would like to add?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Konstantina&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, a few words about the kind of thinking I just touched upon. When we go to restaurants, if they bring us a decent portion of food, we complain that we paid too much to deserve such small portions. But if they bring us huge portions, we feel satisfied even when we don’t finish it all, eventually contributing to wastage. This needs to change and it’s up to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do believe changing our outlook will be a small step in the right direction. That is all I wanted to add. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The EU and Member States are committed to meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), adopted in September 2015, including a target to halve per capita food waste at the retail and consumer level by 2030 and reduce food losses along the food production and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligned with Konstantina’s beliefs, &lt;strong&gt;fruits and vegetables do have the highest wastage rates, followed by meat and milk&lt;/strong&gt;. Annual per capita household food waste (in kilograms per year) of &lt;strong&gt;Greece is among the highest in the world at 142, next to only Nigeria at 189&lt;/strong&gt;, as of 2020, according to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/933059/per-capita-food-waste-of-selected-countries/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Statista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains a grim situation but with the help of NGOs and other institutions, this matter can capture the greater part of the public’s attention and change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to raise awareness about this issue or educate yourself, here are a few food waste initiatives operating in Greece that you can be a part of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boroume.gr/en/&quot;&gt;BOROUME&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a non-profit organisation that fights food waste by organizing the distribution of surplus food for charity throughout Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://artosdrasi.rei.gr/&quot;&gt;Bread and Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; collects and distributes large edible food leftovers or cooked food, to needy service centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sustainablegastronomy.eu/blog.aspx&quot;&gt;Sustainablegastronomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has a blog that regularly shares information about the practices and impacts revolving around food waste and management incentives in Greece&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wastage of food is a blatant affront to all the resources that go into producing, packaging, and distributing it. It not only affects the people and the economy in myriad ways, but it harms major natural resources such as air, water, and land. To reduce food waste, we need to focus on all aspects of the supply chain and increase the quality and quantity of governmental regulations, to name a few. Needless to say, educating the public about the consequences of food waste and management must be one of the top priorities so that we can all play our small roles in tackling this epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being exposed to the elements 24/7 does great damage to your house. Windows are among the many that take a constant beating. If your windows are made of aluminum or any other metal, then you must know from first-hand experience that they lose their shine and look dull after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering whether you can paint aluminum window frames or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to that is &lt;strong&gt;yes, you can paint your aluminium window frames and get them to look good as new in no time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this article, you will find answers to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-make-aluminum-window-frames-look-better&quot;&gt;How to Make Aluminum Window Frames Look Better?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a pity that aluminum window frames weather scratches, dullness, discoloration and lose their sheen over time. Painting them is an easy and inexpensive process to refurbish their tired, worn look. Let’s explore how to paint and give your aluminum window frames a complete makeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety precautions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DIY projects are fun and extremely satisfying. But taking safety precautions while handling such chemical substances is paramount. Wear gloves, safety goggles and respirators or masks while performing the next steps and keep your vicinity well ventilated to prevent buildup of toxic chemicals in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also advisable to protect your glass panes and surrounding walls while you perform this entire operation. Use Painter’s tape to seal off the glass from the frame and masking paper or plastic to protect the rest of the glass area. Also, use drip sheets on the floor to keep them from staining or any paint mishap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleaning your frames&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tricky to make paint adhere to metal surfaces. It’s even trickier when there is dust, grime and debris present between the metal and paint coats. It’s therefore, necessary to clean your window frames thoroughly before moving on to the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can clean your frames using a no-soap or mild soap solution and a soft cloth. Micro-fiber cloth would be the gentlest option. If there is any indication of rust, try using a soft sandpaper to remove the layers and clean the remains. Make sure to pat dry the frames, especially the grooves and joints, so that there is no water deposit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying Primer&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priming is an essential step that, however tempting it may seem, should not be missed. Priming provides the metal surface with a smooth finish and prepares it to accept paint coats flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primer you choose should be oil-based and primarily come with rust-inhibitive properties. You could also go for self-etching primers as they lend enhanced adhesion to the paint. You can get a paint brush or roller to apply the primer or go for various spray paint primers. Spray paint primers are preferred as they help in applying thin coats which is the key to give your aluminum window frames a high-finish, professional look after the paint job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After applying primer to your window frames, let that primer settle for a few hours before you start with the painting process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying Paint&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that your window frames are cleaned, primed and fully prepped, they are ready to be painted over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-quality acrylic paints tend to be the best kind of paints for aluminum window frames. Make sure to check the paint instructions beforehand and verify if it’s suitable to be used on aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, metal spray paints are a great option to reduce any incidence of excess buildup or dripping. Spray paints are easier to handle and manuever in order to render thin coats of paint which is essential to achieve an even finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your application should be steady with back and forth movements, all the while ensuring that the coats are even and thin. Let layers dry for a few minutes in case of spray paints and a period of 6-7 hours in case of acrylic paint before going for more layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave your paint to dry and check for any textural defects. If you find any, scrape them off with a sleak blade causing minimum damage. Voila! Your window frames will be looking as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-cost-to-paint-aluminum-window-frames&quot;&gt;What is the cost to paint aluminum window frames?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole cost of the project would depend upon the size and number of window frames you need to paint. If you have a few window frames to paint, then it’s safe to estimate that you will be able to wrap up the &lt;strong&gt;whole project in under $150&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have a lot of area to cover, then you might have to compare the cost of doing it all by yourself with hiring professionals for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, it’d take around one to two standard cans of spray for a single large window. Considering this and that you have the cleaning supplies and other optional supplies like ladder at hand, here’s the rest of your cost estimate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A can of spray paint: $10-$15 for 12oz,
Or, Acrylic paint: $45 to $50 per gallon,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paint Primer: $15 to $25 per gallon,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drop Cloth: $10-$30&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scrub Brush: $10-$25&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tape and paper to protect surfaces: $5 each, per roll&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going the DIY route for painting your aluminum window frames would be considerably lower in cost than replacing them or hiring a contractor. For this task, you will need supplies such as masking paper, painter’s tape, drop clothes, sandpaper, safety goggles, ladder etc in addition to the primer and paint. If you choose to go for spraying your primer and paint, you will save on time and costs since you can skip out on buying paint brushes or rollers. Spray paints also dry faster than other kinds of paints.&lt;/p&gt;
