        <h1 id="carbon-pricing---is-it-the-end-all-be-all-solution-to-fight-climate-change">Carbon pricing - is it the end all be all solution to fight climate change?</h1>

<p>Carbon pricing has dominated the list of buzzworthy terms related to climate action lately, partly due to the much discussed event COP26, held last year. It’s been touted as an effective tool to combat rising levels of greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions by experts and pundits all over the world. 
<br /> <br />
<strong>But</strong> how effective has it been in producing real, tangible results in terms of reducing overall emissions and decarbonizing the environment?</p>

<p>Carbon pricing works by either levying taxes on emissions via a carbon tax or limiting the amount of emissions allowed for industries via Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), to put it simply. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at ETS. And to better understand the cracks and faults in the system, it is imperative to have a general idea of how this scheme works.</p>

<h2 id="ets-and-how-it-works">ETS and how it works</h2>
<p>ETS is an interesting mechanism for incentivizing firms to keep their carbon emissions under check. Under the Emissions Trading Scheme, a market is established for the trading of emissions as commodities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Companies that are huge in scale and involved in carbon-intensive operations receive free or traded allowances annually.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The government sets a ceiling on the amount of allowances available for all (cap). Each year, the cap is lowered in order to lessen the gross emissions and achieve the reduction targets. (The EU had set a goal of 21% reduction in emissions by 2020 from the threshold set in 2005 and 43% reduction by 2030). It is therefore, also called the cap-and-trade principle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Companies surrender an amount of allowances equivalent to their annual emissions of GHG in tonnes (one allowance grants them the consent to emit 1 tonne of CO2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who produce more than their allocated share must purchase more via trade or auction to compensate for the deficit. Those who produce less than their share are free to trade those allowances to companies or industries in deficit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In theory, this scheme was supposed to push firms to switch to low carbon technologies, invest more in R&amp;D and look for better alternatives to keep the carbon footprint of their entire supply chain well below the expected level. But the reality has been confoundingly different.</p>

<h2 id="wherein-lies-the-problem">Wherein lies the problem?</h2>
<p>The market’s influence on this scheme gives the notion that it creates a fair playing ground for all participants, but it’s not entirely the case, as it has worked somewhat in favor of the firms.</p>

<p>Because of the supply and demand parameters involved, the price of emissions per tonne of Co2 is usually extremely low in most countries. The carbon prices have been well below the estimated ‘social cost of carbon’ - cost associated with the environmental and health effects of greenhouse gas emissions. The <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2019/12/the-case-for-carbon-taxation-and-putting-a-price-on-pollution-parry.htm">IMF estimates</a> that the average global price for carbon is <strong>$2 per tonne</strong>, while a conservative estimate put together by the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (<a href="https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/report-of-the-highlevel-commission-on-carbon-prices">CPLC</a>) puts the SCC between <strong>$50 and $100</strong> by 2030. As you can see, the current prices are simply not enough to offset the current levels of carbon.</p>

<p>The reality regarding the success of countries with decent carbon prices like Sweden with the current price of US$119 per ton (World Bank Group <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/33809">2020</a>) also presents a dismal result. Allocating a higher price has still not led to considerable reductions in emissions per year.</p>

<h2 id="is-that-all">Is that all?</h2>
<p>Hardly. Then there’s the matter of carbon leakage that is overwhelmingly underreported and ignored. Firms and businesses are responsible for monitoring their emissions strictly occurring within their countries. The current structure involving non standardized policy and pricing across jurisdictions and countries gives way to businesses moving their operations elsewhere to keep their emissions low on paper. Hence, the term <strong>“carbon leakage”</strong>.</p>

<p>There have also been a few cases of misreporting of total emissions by huge firms such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/31/australian-regulator-finds-large-scale-emissions-misreporting-by-coalminer-peabody#:~:text=Australian%20regulator%20finds%20large%2Dscale%20emissions%20misreporting%20by%20coalminer%20Peabody,-US%20giant%20agrees&amp;text=The%20total%20error%20was%20large,largely%20cancelled%20each%20other%20out.">this</a> incident. The onus to diligently record and report their total emissions falls on firms, and while there are regulators in place to oversee that, it’s not a reach to assume that not all the reportings are checked for inconsistencies.</p>

<p><strong>Another</strong> critique that could be leveled is that certain industries, such as electricity, are heavily under the lens because of the relative ease of tracking the fixed sources of generation and distribution. On the other hand, industries like agro-food where there are a number of highly variable parameters (dietary habits, soil conditions, climate, to name a few) are not easy to assess and price effectively. As a result, quite a few industries that are heavy polluters are still not under the pricing policy and therefore have no incentive to check their emissions.</p>

<p>As a result, businesses have not made strides in changing technologies and methodologies, as the price to pay for doing business as usual is lower than shifting towards more climate friendly options. Unsurprisingly, these pricing measures <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518304063">haven’t incentivized innovations</a> in the field of clean energy or low carbon technologies as popularly believed. Businesses have instead gone on to choose the least expensive option that fulfills their obligations to their governments.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-next">So, what next?</h2>
<p>Carbon pricing as the primary means of combating the carbon menace is not the best school of thought to follow. Real, tangible change that can be brought on by steps such as phasing out coal, removing subsidies for fossil fuel industries, shifting away from the reliance on carbon intensive technologies are a few compelling steps needed right now.</p>

<p>The right way forward would be to run a tight ship of administrators and regulators who would determine fair yet effective carbon prices, keep track of the allowances in emissions tradings, monitor and prevent carbon leakage, while encouraging more businesses to adopt systematic changes in their workings.</p>

<p>To pave the way for better policies, policy makers and leaders need to effectively communicate to people from all walks of life, about their varying roles in shouldering the shift to a greener economy. The most vulnerable portion of the population would need the most support in fiscal and educational terms to cushion this transition. After all, no significant change can be brought on without holding the major culprits accountable and including the most vulnerable to the discourse.</p>
